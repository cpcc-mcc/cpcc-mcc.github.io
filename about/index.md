I wish I had the courage to commit to a bit like you 'Abed' or to a relationship like Troy.  Committing is hard cause we are all scared of what happens when we find out we committed to the wrong thing...but there's no shame in what Troy's done.  He put himself out there and he really tried and that proves he cares.  That said, and as hard as it may seem right now, Troy needs to show he cares.  He needs to put himself out there and own how he feels.  That proves he's a man.
It seems impossible.  Something impossible actually seems more likely.  What if a ghost to the pen?...For real?  Honestly, seriously, why not?  Why not just a ghost took the pen, and should we should have been listening to Troy from the beginning?  Guys, look in your hearts and answer this question honestly: what's more likely, that someone in this group doesn't belong in this group, or ghosts?  If we have to choose between turning on each other or pinning it on some specter with unfinished pen-related business, I'm sorry but, my money's on ghosts.
Look, we've known each other for almost two years now, and yeah, in that time I've given a lot of speeches, but they all have one thing in common: they're all different.  These drug runners aren't going to execute Pierce because he's racist, it's a locomotive that runs on us, and the only sharks that are in that water are the emotional ghosts that I like to call fear, anchovy, fear, and the dangers of ingesting mercury.  Because the real bugs aren't the ones in those beds and there's no such thing as a free caesar salad and even if there were The Cape may still find a second life on cable, and I'll tell you why: el corazon del agua es verdad, that water is a lie!  Harrison Ford is irradiating our testicles with microwave satellite transmissions!  So maybe we are caught in an endless cycle of screw-ups and hurt feelings, but I choose to believe itâ€™s just the universe's way of molding us into some kind of supergroup....Yes, Troy, like the Traveling Wilburys of pain, prepared for any insane adventure life throws our way, and I don't about you, but I'm looking forward to every one of them.
